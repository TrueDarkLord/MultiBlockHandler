# What is this plugin?
It's a simple plugin that adds multiblock drops into the initial BlockDropItemEvent.

# Features
- Collects all multiblock drops and stores them in a single event.

The current version of the plugin was intentionally kept simple to reduce the likelihood of it breaking between different Minecraft versions.

# Setup:
- Download the jar file.
- Place the file into your server's plugin folder.
- Start the server and Enjoy!
